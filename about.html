    <div class="col-sm-12">YouTiming is a system that serves as a bridge between the market price fluctuations and the <em>Book of Change</em> (BOC, aka <em>I-Ching</em> 易經--probably the earliest and the most ancient Big Data Model as in today's terms). The system applies the <em>BOC</em> as the source of forecast and finds a timingly appropriate verse for the computed trend.<br><br>
    The stock market is a very efficient discounting mechanism. YouTiming maps that mechanism into <i>BOC</i> and gives you a future vision from the perspective of <em>I-Ching</em>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
