	    	<li>Assumes that the market price fluctuation is the result of crowd's behavior to discount the future political and/or economic events in order to attain the goal that profit can be maximized and loss can be minimized.</li>
	    	<li>Thus, the presnt price fluctuation made by the crowd matrix is a "reflection" about what the future would look like. The concept can be bestly described by this verse, "So the last will be first, and the first will be last." (Matthew 20:16).</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact that, after being tested for thousands of years, the Book of Change (aka I-Ching) is the model that can systematically map and link the "name", as known by the present timing, to the "value" sitting on the future timeline.</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact, as derived from the I-Ching model, that any timeline consists of two sub-axes or backbones--i.e., the <em>yang</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(positive) sub-axis and the <em>yin</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(negative) sub-axis.</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact that the matrix forms a "execution context" at a particular timing he chooses by his own free will to open up the door that enables us to metaphorically "understand" the picture of the future.
	    	<li>My prediction (2015-03-20): In the future, there will be a way to produce the "biological" data as the activity-matrix belonged to each individual through the personal smart device. When that day comes, this system can allow each individual to automatically understand his metaphorical "door" of timing leading into the future. With the entire market-sector-maxtrix (SP-500, Nasdaq-100, for instances, depending on the individual's selection), to be used as the mentor-performance-library, this I believe, will be the next phase social network revolution, because this process allows one to conduct two-dimensional social networking rather than one-dimensional or the "horizontal" type made by Facebook and LinkedIn.</li>
