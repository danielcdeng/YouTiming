	    	<li>Assumes that the market price fluctuation is the result of crowd's behavior to discount the future political and/or economic events in order to attain the goal that profit can be maximized and loss can be minimized. （趨吉避凶，潛龍勿用）</li>
	    	<li>Thus, the present price fluctuation made by the crowd (matrix) is a reflection or mirror about what the future would walk into. （龍現在田，利見大人）</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact that, after being tested for thousands of years, the Book of Change (aka I-Ching) is the model that can systematically map and link the "name", as known by the present timing, to the "value" sitting on the future timeline. （君子終日乾乾，夕惕若。厲，无咎）</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact, as derived from the I-Ching model, that any timeline consists of two sub-axes or backbones--i.e., the yang (positive) sub-axis and the yin (negative) sub-axis. （或躍或淵，无咎）</li>
	    	<li>Thus, the future picture linked by the dated timing provided by the crowd (or matrix) is the key that holds the bullish (yang) integrity of the future. （飛龍在天，利見大人）</li>
	    	<li>My prediction (2015-03-20): In the future, there will be a way to produce a set of biological or neural data that can uniquely represents each individual's "market fluctuation". When that day comes, this system can provide future guidance service customized for each individual. By applying the entire market sector (i.e., the crowd behavior) as the decision-making reference library, one can easily derive his future gain/loss from the library, plus the past political-economical trend as a reference for his future life trend to attain the goal of maximizing the positive (yang) while minimizing the negative (yin). For this, I believe, will be one of the backbones during the next phase of social networking development. The new one will be two-dimensional as compared to the present "horizontal" type. （時至，亢龍應該要變，不變則會有悔）</li>
