	    	<li>Assumes that the market price fluctuation is the result of crowd's behavior to discount the future political and/or economic events in order to attain the goal that profit can be maximized and loss can be minimized. （陽勢尚潛，屯運勿用，尚在啟蒙，用則有訟）</li>
	    	<li>Thus, the present price fluctuation made by the crowd (matrix) is a reflection or mirror of what the future would walk into. （冬盡春苗，耕謙在田，大運將臨，剝盡來復）</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact that, after being tested for thousands of years, the Book of Change (aka I-Ching) is the model that can systematically map and link the "name", known by the present timing, to the "value" sitting on the future timeline. （君子戰剝，終日夕惕，大畜之厲，甘頤无咎）</li>
	    	<li>Accepts the fact, as derived from the I-Ching model, that any timeline consists of two sub-axes or backbones--i.e., the yang (positive) sub-axis and the yin (negative) sub-axis. （君子內心，喜躍悲淵，或歌或泣，陰陽交盪）</li>
	    	<li>Thus, the future picture linked by the dated timing provided by the crowd (or matrix) is the key that holds the bullish (yang) integrity of the future. （大運時至，飛龍在天，利見大仁，以助其豐）</li>
	    	<li>My prediction (2015-03-20): In the future, there will be a way to produce a set of biological or neural data that can uniquely represents each individual's "market fluctuation". When that day comes, this system can provide future guidance service customized for each individual. By applying the entire market sector (i.e., the crowd behavior) as the decision-making reference library, one can easily derive his future gain/loss from the library, plus the past political-economical trend as a reference, for his future life trend to attain the goal of maximizing the positive (yang) while minimizing the negative (yin). For this, I believe, will be one of the backbones during the next phase of social network development. The new backbone will be multi-dimensional as compared to the present "horizontal" type. （運在勢在，未濟之亢，不知時變，運盡有悔）</li>
	    	<li>The Utopia of Social Networking: When people are in the new type of multi-dimensional social network, a flow of autonomus "balance" betweem the positive and negative will be rising because the system can guide the negative to the positive as a learner and the positive to the negative as a servant. A new type of harmony unknown to mankind will be reached during which the boundary between the positive (yang) and the negative (yin) disappears.（洞察預見，群龍無首，主帥知命，僕將知運，主僕互換，大勢復泰，群龍皆吉）
