    <div class="col-sm-12">YouTiming is an information system that acts as a critical layer between the market price fluctuations and the <em>Book of Change</em> (BOC, 易經). The layer applies the <em>BOC</em> as the source of verses to expose the visibility and infuse a "semantic" meaning into the trend that will drive and shape the future.<br><br>
    By learning from the historical data, the pattern can be traced and retrieved. Thus, statistical references can be derived for mid/long-term market trading. The stock market is a very efficient discounting mechanism. YouTiming maps that mechanism into <i>BOC</i> and produces the prophecy-like forecast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
