    <span class='white'>Decipher the market price fluctuations and translate them into delineations made by the verses and/or metaphores stated in the Book of Change (BOC). Note: The BOC, aka <em>I-Ching</em> 易經, is probably the earliest and the most ancient scalable Big Data Model and Framework as in today's terms.<br><br>
    YouTiming is the result of this vision. It is a system that serves as a bridge between the market price fluctuations and the BOC. It applies the BOC as the market forecast framework and finds a timingly appropriate verse for the computed trend.<br><br>
    The stock market is a very efficient discounting mechanism. YouTiming maps the stock market to the Framework and gives you a guidance of how the current market standing will evolve into the future.
